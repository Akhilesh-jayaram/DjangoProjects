Basic Installation and Django Projects


To install Django, you need to have Python installed on your system. Once you have Python installed, you can install Django using pip.
Open a terminal window and type the following command:
pip install django


This will install Django and all of its dependencies.
Creating a new project
Once Django is installed, you can create a new project by typing the following command:
django-admin startproject <project_name>



This will create a new directory called <project_name> that contains all of the files for your Django project.
Creating a new app
To create a new app within your project, type the following command:
python manage.py startapp <app_name>


This will create a new directory called <app_name> within the apps directory of your project.
Running the development server
To run the development server, type the following command:
python manage.py runserver


This will start a development server on your local machine. You can then access your Django project by visiting http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.
Creating a superuser
Before you can start adding content to your Django project, you need to create a superuser. To do this, type the following command:
python manage.py createsuperuser



This will prompt you to enter a username, email address, and password for the superuser.
Managing your project
Once you have created a Django project and app, you can use the Django admin interface to manage your project. To access the admin interface, visit http://localhost:8000/admin/ in your web browser.
You can also use the Django command line to manage your project. For a list of all available commands, type the following command:
python manage.py help
